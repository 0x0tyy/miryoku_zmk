#+Title: Miryoku ZMK [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/logos/miryoku-roa-32.png]]

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/cover/miryoku-kle-cover.png]]

[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/][Miryoku]] is an ergonomic, minimal,
orthogonal, universal keyboard layout.  This is the miryoku implementation for
[[https://zmkfirmware.dev/][ZMK]].

* Miryoku Keymap

The miryoku keymap is a ZMK DT keymap file using C preprocessor macros for
configuration options and to abstract the physical layout.  The file is
[[./miryoku/miryoku.dtsi][miryoku/miryoku.dtsi]].  The file
is included into the keyboard's keymap with 

#+BEGIN_SRC C :tangle no
#include "../miryoku/miryoku.dtsi"
#+END_SRC


* Configuration Options

todo


* Mapping

The keymap is mapped onto keyboards with different physical layouts.  The keymap
is specified in terms of the ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING~ macro.  The macro is defined in a
C header file for each physical layout.  Unused keys are mapped to ~&none~.  The
files are in [[./miryoku/mapping/][miryoku/mapping/]].  The
mapping file is included into the keyboard's keymap file before the miryoku
keymap with e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC C :tangle no
#include "../miryoku/mapping/36-minidox.h"
#+END_SRC

On each hand, only the main alpha block of 3 rows by 5 columns and the 3 most
appropriate thumb keys are used.  Notes or diagrams are included where the
selection of keys is not obvious or where options are provided.

** Layouts

*** 34-ferris

Combos of primary and secondary thumb keys emulate the missing tertiary thumb
key.  To enable with other subset mappings for compatibility, add ~#define
MIRYOKU_COMBO_TPS_ENABLE~ to the keymap before the includes.

*** 42-corne

*** 44-jian

* Keyboard Keymaps

Keymap files for many keyboards included in ZMK are provided in
[[./config/][config/]].

* Prebuilt Firmware

Prebuilt firmware for supported keyboards, built with the default configuration
options, can be downloaded from the repo.  From the
[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku-zmk/actions][Actions]] tab select the
latest successful workflow run, then select the keyboard in the Artifacts
section.

* Contact

For issues with the code, including requests for any of the following, please
[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku-zmk/issues/new][create an issue]].
Pull requests are also welcome.

- Additional mapping and keyboard keymap files
- Additional mapping options (see miryoku QMK for examples)
- Populating unused keys in ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING_TAP~ (currently skipped for some mapping files)
