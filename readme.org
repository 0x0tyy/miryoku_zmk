* Miryoku ZMK [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/logos/miryoku-roa-32.png]]

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/cover/miryoku-kle-cover.png]]

[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/][Miryoku]] is an ergonomic, minimal, orthogonal, and universal keyboard layout.  This is the Miryoku implementation for [[https://zmkfirmware.dev/][ZMK]].


** Building


*** Supported Keyboards

See the various Test [[#github-actions-workflows][workflow]] files for lists of supported keyboards.


**** Board Only

Any [[https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/arm][board supported by ZMK]] with a [[#keyboard-keymaps][keymap in Miryoku ZMK]].


**** Board / Shield Combination

Any compatible combination of [[https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/arm][board supported by ZMK]] and [[https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/shields][shield supported by ZMK]] with a [[#keyboard-keymaps][keymap in Miryoku ZMK]].


**** Out of Tree Boards and Shields

Additionally, some out of tree boards and shields are automatically supported by the included [[#github-actions-workflows][workflows]].  See [[.github/workflows/outboards]].


*** Local Builds

Clone this repo and use for [[https://zmk.dev/docs/development/build-flash#building-from-zmk-config-folder][ZMK_CONFIG]].


*** GitHub Actions Workflows

Workflow files are in [[.github/workflows]].  To access a workflow, log in to GitHub, visit the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/zmk-config/actions][Actions]] tab, and select the workflow.  To download the firmware from a workflow run, select the workflow, select the workflow run, select the desired Artifacts, and unzip the downloaded zip file.

[[#Supported-Keyboards][Supported keyboards]] and [[#configuration-options][configuration options]] can be used as values for the corresponding [[#build-examples][matrix]] or [[#build-inputs][inputs]] options.

The ~kconfig~ option can be used to generate a ~keyboard.conf~.  Join multiple lines with ~\n~.


**** Build Examples

Fork this repo, copy one of the included Build Example workflow files, edit the ~name~ value, and edit the values for each matrix option as desired.


**** Build Inputs

Fork this repo, select the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/zmk-config/actions/workflows/build-inputs.yml][Build Inputs]] workflow, select Run workflow, and fill out the form as desired.  Multiple (comma and / or space separated) values can be entered in each field.  Activate Run workflow, and wait for successful completion.


**** Prebuilt Firmware

Some prebuilt firmware is available from previous workflow runs.


** Miryoku Keymap

The Miryoku keymap is a ZMK DT keymap file using C preprocessor macros for [[#configuration-options][configuration options]] and to abstract the physical layout.  The file is [[miryoku/miryoku.dtsi]].  The file is included into the [[#keyboard-keymaps][keyboard's keymap]] after the config file and mapping with:

#+BEGIN_SRC C :tangle no
#include "../miryoku/miryoku.dtsi"
#+END_SRC


** Configuration Options

[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org#alternative-layouts][Keymap configuration options]] and [[#mapping][mapping]] configuration options are given in the documentation in the form ~option=value~.


*** Use in Local Builds

Convert to the form ~#define option_value~ and add to the [[#config-file][config file]].


*** Use in Workflow Builds

Convert to the form ~value~ (uppercase or lowercase) and use with the corresponding ~option~.  Use ~default~ to represent the default value.


** Config File

The config file can be used to provide [[#configuration-options][configuration options]] for all [[#Local-Builds][local builds]].  The file is [[miryoku/config.h]].  See the [[#example-config-file][example config file]].  The config file is included into the keyboard's keymap file before the mapping with:

#+BEGIN_SRC C :tangle no
#include "../miryoku/config.h"
#+END_SRC


** Example Config File

Below is an example [[#config-file][config file]] with the following keymap [[#configuration-options][configuration options]]:

- ~MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY~
- ~MIRYOKU_NAV=VI~
- ~MIRYOKU_CLIPBOARD=WIN~

#+BEGIN_SRC C :tangle no
// Copyright 2021 Manna Harbour
// https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku

#define MIRYOKU_ALPHAS_QWERTY
#define MIRYOKU_NAV_VI
#define MIRYOKU_CLIPBOARD_WIN
#+END_SRC


** Mapping

The keymap is mapped onto keyboards with different physical layouts.  The keymap is specified in terms of the ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING~ macro.  The macro is defined in a C header file for each physical layout.  Unused keys are mapped to ~&none~.  The files are in [[miryoku/mapping/]].  The mapping file is included into the keyboard's keymap file before the Miryoku keymap with e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC C :tangle no
#include "../miryoku/mapping/36-minidox.h"
#+END_SRC

On each hand, only the main alpha block of 3 rows by 5 columns and the 3 most appropriate thumb keys are used.


*** Notes

Notes or diagrams are included where the selection of keys is not obvious or where alternatives are provided via mapping [[#configuration-options][configuration options]].


**** 34-ferris

~MIRYOKU_COMBO_TPS=ENABLE~

Combos of primary and secondary thumb keys emulate the missing tertiary thumb key.  This [[#configuration-options][configuration option]] is enabled automatically for this mapping and can be enabled on other mappings for compatibility.


**** 48-planck
