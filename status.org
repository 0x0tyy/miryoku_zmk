* Status

Welcome to the alpha of miryoku ZMK!

You've been added as a collaborator to the repo as it's the easiest way to give
access.  You're not expected to contribute but contributions are welcome.  In
that case please create a new branch and PR.  Otherwise, if you could avoid
accidental force pushes to master that'd be great!  The layout should be usable
now but there's still some work to do before it's published, so please don't
redistribute.  If you fork, please make the repo private.

Just a bit of an explanation of the current status: I'm doing a miryoku
reorganisation at the moment.  The general layout docs will move out of the QMK
repo and get expanded.  The org stuff will also move and will generate QMK, ZMK,
and KMonad.  At the moment the org stuff in ZMK is separate until I finalise the
scripts and re-integrate the changes, so it's a bit of a mess right now but the
generated keymap shouldn't change much.

** Todo

*** TODO Integrate with Zephyr CMake

Support passing configuration options.  For now, add the equivalent ~#define~ to
your keymap before the includes, e.g. for ~MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY~ add ~#define
MIRYOKU_ALPHAS_QWERTY~.
